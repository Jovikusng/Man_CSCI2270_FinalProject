# Man_CSCI2270_FinalProject
I make a game for this final project. It is called Gobang.
It can play with computer also can play with another player. And I will tell you how to play and how to run this program in another file, here is the link.
I work it on the Mac and I think it can be running in the windows too.
There is no need for users to download any other library to run the game. Just download the Gobang.cpp and open it in the Virtual Machine Code::Blocks.
